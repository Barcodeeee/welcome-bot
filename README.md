---OUT DATED AND MAY NO LONGER WORK---
 A Simple Discord Welcome Bot (Needs EMBED_MESSAGE perms)
## Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Getting started

First, make sure you have all the required tools installed on your local machine then continue with these steps.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/axpgf/welcome-bot

# Enter into the directory
cd discord-bot/

```

### Configuration

After cloning the project and installing all dependencies, you need to add your Discord API token in the config.json file.
Make sure you made a bot application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
Copy your bots token and paste it in your **config.json** file replacing the **TOKEN_HERE**
Head over to your **index.js** and read the little comments I have left.
The comments explain what to do and what to replace.

### Starting the application

```bash
node index.js
```
